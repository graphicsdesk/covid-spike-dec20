## Data

#### `assets/COLUMBIA_SURVEILLANCE_TESTING_RESULTS_-_Sheet1.csv`

I copy-pasted the first table [here](https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/columbia-surveillance-testing-results) into a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gujVn8vHhuGmWB3-KXI2-s23dXhnTRTc-r2tYpLUvC0/edit#gid=0), then downloaded the sheet as a CSV. This CSV is converted into JSON (`data/columbia-testing.json`) with the Makefile.
